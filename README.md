This project uses VBA code to loop through multiple sheets of stock data to list each individual stock, calculate the change over the quarter, generate a percent change, and get a total volume of each stock. The macro then loops through the summarized data, and returns stocks with the greatest % increase/decrease (open price to close price) and greatest total stock volume. 






My code was derived from class activites and researching Microsoft examples on different ways to loop through worksheets. There was nothing directly copied from outside sources.
